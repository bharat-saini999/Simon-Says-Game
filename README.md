# Simon-Says-Game
Created a Game using Development
A classic Simon Says memory game built as an interactive web application. The game challenges players to memorize and repeat an increasingly long sequence of colors and sounds, testing concentration and recall. It features dynamic UI updates, event-driven gameplay, and progressive difficulty. The project is developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, focusing on DOM manipulation, game state management, and responsive design to deliver a smooth and engaging user experience across devices.
